## Estimated toy cost

Making a single toy actually consumed:

 Item | Used | Cost
-- | -- | --
Brush on silicone | 9.5 ounces | 9.66
Thi-vex | 1 gram | 0.31
Plaster bandages | 2 rolls, | 3.15
Release agent | Unknown | ?
Mica | 14 grams | 4.27
Casting silicone | 25 fl oz | 31.00
**Total** | |  48.39

Some amounts above are estimates, as the work hasn't been done yet.

A second, identical toy would be cheaper (~$35) because the mold has already been made.


## Things I had already, and didn't need to purchase

* Generic, cheap sculpting tools. I had one loop tool, and various flat tools.
* Guitar strings. I used a spare set to create fine rake tools
* Plastic cups, condiment cups, plastic flatware, popsicle sticks
* Cheap, synthetic brushes
* Odorless mineral spirits
* Dremel and cut off wheels, used for making rake tools
* Dish soap and mineral oil for smoothing clay

## Things I have not purchased yet, but may/will need

* More silicone. Won't know for sure until the mold is done.
* Larger mixing containers.
* Silicone accelerant for slush casting.
* Vacuum pump and chamber for silicone degassing. I'm hoping I can get away without this using 

## Things I bought, and didn't use

* 1/4&quot; wooden dowels for tool making
* FlexFoam-iT III for as a mold support
* Lexan sheet, because I'm not using the foam

## Cutting costs:

Things I didn't absolutely need to buy:

* All of the sculpting tools. I used them, but it could have been done without them.
* Armature wire and used stiffer copper wire, which I already had
* Silicone retardant, and just work faster.
* Lexan sheet. I could have built a larger volume square box instead with scraps.
* Mica or pigment. Color isn't strictly required.
