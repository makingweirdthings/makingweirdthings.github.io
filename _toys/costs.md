## Materials

Brass tubing | 4.69
Lazy susan | 10.99
Scraper tools | 7.99
Bass string set | 7.99
Fixit sculpt | 26.95
Lexan sheet | 12.45
**Total** | **83.05**

### Spent so far: $295.40 USD

## Estimated toy cost

Some items are reusable (tools, clay), and represent one time costs. 

Some consumable materials use only a portion of what I purchased.

Making a single toy actually consumed:

 Item | Used | Cost
-- | -- | --
Brush on silicone | 3.2 ounces (~ 7%) estimated | 2.30
Foam | 1/3 lb (~ 12%) estimated | 3.63
Release agent | Unknown | ?
Mica | 21 grams | 4.10
Casting silicone | 25 fl oz | 31.00
**Total** | |  **41.03**

A second, identical toy would be cheaper ($35) because the mold has already been made.



## Things I had already, and didn't need to purchase

* Generic sculpting tools. I had one loop tool, and various flat tools.
* Guitar strings. I used a spare set to create fine rake tools
* Plastic cups, condiment cups, plastic flatware, popsicle sticks
* Cheap, synthetic brushes
* Odorless mineral spirits
* Dish soap and mineral oil for smoothing clay

## Things I have not purchased yet, but may/will need

* More silicone. Won't know for sure until the mold is done.
* Larger mixing containers.
* Silicone accelerant for slush casting.
* Vacuum pump and chamber for silicone degassing. I'm hoping I can get away without this using 


## Cutting costs:

Things I didn't actually need to buy:

* All of the sculpting, but I like them.
* Armature wire and used stiffer copper wire, which I already had
* Silicone retardant, and just work faster
* Lexan sheet, and built a larger volume square box instead with scraps
* Mica or pigment
