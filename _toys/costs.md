Here's what I've purchased for this project so far.

## Materials

-- | -- | --
Clay (NSP Chavant Hard) | 2 lbs | 22.85
Armature wire | Various sizes/lengths | 8.99
Mica | Various, 2.75oz total | 23.80
Silicone (Ecoflex 00-50) | 2 lbs | 32.21
Silicone thickener (Thi-vex) | 1oz | 8.89
Cure retardant (Slo-Jo) | 1 lb | 17.87
Release agent | 12oz can | 13.86
Expanding foam (FlexFoam-iT III) | 2.8lbs | 30.29
**Total** | | **158.76**

## Tools

Item | Price
--: | :--
Loop tool set | 11.99
Brass tubing | 4.69
Lazy susan | 10.99
Scraper tools | 7.99
Bass string set | 7.99
Fixit sculpt | 26.95
Lexan sheet | 12.45

### Spent so far: $241.81 USD

## Estimated toy cost

Some items are reusable (tools, clay), and represent one time costs. 

Some consumable materials use only a portion of what I purchased.

Making a single toy actually consumed:

 Item | Used | Cost
-- | -- | --
Brush on silicone | 3.2 ounces (~ 7%) | 2.30
Foam | 3/4 lb (~ 26%) | 7.80
Release agent | Unknown | ?
Mica | 21 grams | 9.75
Casting silicone | 25 fl oz | 31.00
**Total** | |  **50.85**

All amounts above are estimates, as the work hasn't been done yet.

A second, identical toy would be cheaper ($41) because the mold has already been made.


## Things I had already, and didn't need to purchase

* Generic, cheap sculpting tools. I had one loop tool, and various flat tools.
* Guitar strings. I used a spare set to create fine rake tools
* Plastic cups, condiment cups, plastic flatware, popsicle sticks
* Cheap, synthetic brushes
* Odorless mineral spirits
* Dremel and cut off wheels, used for making rake tools
* Dish soap and mineral oil for smoothing clay

## Things I have not purchased yet, but may/will need

* More silicone. Won't know for sure until the mold is done.
* Larger mixing containers.
* Silicone accelerant for slush casting.
* Vacuum pump and chamber for silicone degassing. I'm hoping I can get away without this using 


## Cutting costs:

Things I didn't absolutely need to buy:

* All of the sculpting tools. I used them, but it could have been done without them.
* Armature wire and used stiffer copper wire, which I already had
* Silicone retardant, and just work faster.
* Lexan sheet. I could have built a larger volume square box instead with scraps.
* Mica or pigment. Color isn't strictly required.
