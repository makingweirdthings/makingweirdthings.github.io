Much more detail about the process modeling and molding process, and associated costs can be found [at my first attempt](/toys/first-attempt).

Here, I'll be making a long, skinny toy, mostly designed for deep-throating. I'm hoping to make a dual density toy by slush casting
softer (00-20 or 00-30) silicone into the mold first, before pouring a firmer (A20) core. This may work, but I haven't seen
anybody try it, and it will probably be a challenge with this toy due to the shape. I expect this could more easily be done
with short, fat toy instead.

If it doesn't work out, I'll just cast it normally in 5A. 

## Sculpting

I'm using Chavant NSP Hard again for this model.

I started with aluminum armature wire, and wrapped that in crumpled aluminum foil. I knew in advance what 
dimensions I was looking for, so built the armature out to a around 1/2&quot; in diameter less than I was targetting.

I think I could left closer to 3/8&quot; or 1/4&quot; and still had plenty of clay to work with, and could have built
it up to the final size more easily.

After scultping the head and veins and raking everything down, I smooth by hand, using mineral oil and dish soap. 
I still haven't figured out a better way to do this, and the mineral oil leaves the clay sticky and prone no leaving finger
prints.

For fun, I measured and added inch marks along one side.

## Molding

I'm using Rebound 25 again for the mold. I started with 2 thin layers, brushed on (around 40 and 50 grams each), followed
by a 90 gram layer, thickened with Thi-Vex, and applied with a big popsicle stick. I cut a couple of pieces of silicone
from a the last project's leftovers, and stuck these down into the third layer to help register the mold shell later
