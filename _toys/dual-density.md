Much more detail about the process modeling and molding process, and associated costs can be found [at my first attempt](/toys/first-attempt).

Here, I'll be making a long, skinny toy, mostly designed for deep-throating. 

I'm hoping to make a dual density toy by slush casting softer (00-20 or 00-30) silicone into the mold first, before
pouring a firmer (A20) core. This may work.
 
I haven't seen anybody make a toy this way, and that's probably for a good reason. In the couple of tutorials I've seen,
they start by casting the firm core first, and then dunk that in the outer mold, half filled with soft silicone.

I've also then seen posts about the two layers delaminating, and I suspect this is because the core has fully cured before
adding more silicone, where you'd want it to be at the tacky stage for proper fusing.

The toy I'm making will be a challenge for this kind of casting, even if it is possible, because of the long, skinny shape.
If it doesn't work out, I'll just cast as a single density toy instead.

## Sculpting

I'm using Chavant NSP Hard again for this model.

I started with aluminum armature wire, and wrapped that in crumpled aluminum foil. I knew in advance what 
dimensions I was looking for, so built the armature out to a around 1/2&quot; in diameter less than I was targetting.

I think I could left closer to 3/8&quot; or 1/4&quot; and still had plenty of clay to work with, and could have built
it up to the final size more easily.

After scultping the head and veins and raking everything down, I smooth by hand, using mineral oil and dish soap. 
I still haven't figured out a better way to do this, and the mineral oil leaves the clay sticky and prone no leaving finger
prints.

For fun, I measured and added inch marks along one side.

## Molding

I'm using Rebound 25 again for the mold. I started with 2 thin layers, brushed on (around 40 and 50 grams each), followed
by a 90 gram layer, thickened with Thi-Vex, and applied with a big popsicle stick. I cut a couple of pieces of silicone
from a the last project's leftovers, and stuck these down into the third layer to help register the mold shell later

## Support shell

For the shell, I'm using extra fast plaster bandages again. This one took about three, nine-foot rolls. I made it slightly differently
this time, by creating the first side as normal, then butting up a second edge next to the first one, followed by an overlapping
strip across the seam (released with petroleum jelly). For this tall, thin model, this felt like a lot more work, and
it was more difficult to keep the thickness even. Still, it makes for a nice clean seam with a sharper "stop" where the
halves meet.
