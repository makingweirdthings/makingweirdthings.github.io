I'm hoping to make a dual density toy by slush casting softer (00-20 or 00-30) silicone into the mold first, before
pouring a firmer (A20) core. This may work.
 
I haven't seen anybody make a toy this way, and that's probably for a good reason. In the couple of tutorials I've seen,
they start by casting the firm core first, and then dunk that in the outer mold, half filled with soft silicone.

I've also then seen posts about the two layers delaminating, and I suspect this is because the core has fully cured before
adding more silicone, where you'd want it to be at the tacky stage for proper fusing.

While [making another toy](/toys/second-attempt), I had a few ounces of spare, low-viscosity silicone mixed up, and decided
to roll it around inside the mixing cup as it cured. 

Slush casting like this is possible if the material cures in stages, allowing the silicone to cure in thin layers as it coats
the inside of the mold, rather than curing all at once.

About 55 minutes after mixing (35 after the end of the pot life), the silicone began setting up, largely without maintaining a coating
layer, and introducing large bubbles in the (increasingly gelatinous) blob.

I'm still hopeful that there's another way to make dual density toys without issues of alignment (I have a couple of factory-made
dual density toys where the inner core is off center, or even nearly at the outside edge of the toy, so this is still an
issue in large-scale manufacturing), cure timing and delamination, but I don't think this is it.
