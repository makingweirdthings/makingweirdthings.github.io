My first attempt at silicone casting: making a large, fantasy/unrealistic dildo.

There's a great deal of quality information available for the modeling/molding/casting process, but rarely in one place,
and mostly not specific to sex toys, which have their own unique challenges.

I haven't done any molding/casting before, so [some mistakes will be made](/toys/mistakes).

## Materials

I'll primarily be using the following materials

* Chavant NSP clay for the positive model
* Smooth-On Rebound 25 brush on silicone for the mold
* Smooth-On FlexFoam-iT III for the mold shell
* Smooth-On Ecoflex 00-50 silicone for the cast
* Cosmetic mica for color

Detailed materials and parts list (with cost) here: [Material costs](/toys/costs)

## Sculpting

For clay, I'm using Chavant NSP, in hard. NSP is a oil, wax, and mineral clay
that does not dry out or harden. At room temperature, it's pretty firm, and can be carved and accepts
sharp detail. It's non-sulphur, and won't prevent platinum silicone from curing.

While I like that the clay can be reused, and that it's firm enough not to show fingerprints every time I touch it,
I would probably prefer to use a polymer clay (like Super Sculpey) for a smaller toy.
After baking, it can be sanded and filled to get a a very smooth finish, with much less effort.

I started with 2 lbs of clay, softened in the microwave. I used 1/4&quot; armature wire,
and wrapped crumpled aluminum foil around that to bulk out to about 1&quot; in diameter.

I wrapped and mooshed the softened clay around the armature and foil, and made rough base, and bulked it out further
with coils of clay.

If I did this again, I'd better plan out what I was working on (with a drawing), and the dimensions
I wanted to target. I could have been using more foil and less clay (this used about 1.5lbs, but
 could have used less than half of that with better planning). Instead, I just kind of built
it up organically until I liked it, and then added a big knot in the middle for no real reason.

### Tools

I made a couple of different types rake tools to help level and smooth surfaces. For coarse tools,
I cut teeth into ribbon/loop tools with a dremel and a cutting wheel.

For finer rakes, I used 3 different gauges of steel instrument strings (bass and guitar).

For the guitar ones, I cut two short lengths of wire and wedged the ends into
1/4&quot; brass tubing, and crimped the ends together. Then, I added Fixit Sculpt for support, and to keep
the loops from flexing as much.

See: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m55SDY4x098>{: rel="noreferrer} on making rake tools like these.

For the bass strings, I whipped the ends with finer gauge wire so that they'd keep their shape, and
embedded them in Fixit Sculpt, as a handle.

### Smoothing

First, I try to get the shape close without worrying about the surface, and erring on the side of too
much clay, rather than too little.

After letting the warm clay cool, or chilling it in the refrigerator, I used the toothed loop tools above
to knock down high spots, and rough in the shape.

I tried a few things to get a smooth surface after using a fine rake.

I tried heat, using both butane torch, and a small heat gun, but both were difficult to control, either
causing the surface to bubble, or not heat quickly enough causing deformation.

For solvents, I tried both rubbing alcohol and mineral oil. Both worked, but the alcohol was
unpredictable and I was worried about ruining the clay. Mineral oil made smoothing easy,
but left the surface tacky. It still seems useful, but I'm not sure how to fix the stickiness.

In the end, I just used dish soap to prevent the clay from smearing and tearing and tried to press it smooth
by hand as best I could.

This model is about 9.5&quot; long total, and 2.75&quot; in diameter at the widest point, 2.25&quot; at the head.

### Details

After basic smoothing, I went back in and added some additional detail around the head, and rolled out clay snakes to make
veins around the base.

I decided to make the toy's base taller, so that running a little short on silicone (or mixing a bit too much) would 
still make for an adequate base. I just smoothed down a pancake of clay and stuck it on the bottom.

I could have gotten a more professional result here by making sure the base was both level and circular. It could have been
cut out of wood, or just built on top of some round platform instead.

I did one more pass at smoothing rough spots, filling in pits, and removing little lint balls of clay that accumulated.

## Molding

For the mold, I'm using Smooth-On's Rebound 25 to make a one-piece, flexible, glove mold, 
and then plan to support it with expanding foam. See:
<https://www.polytek.com/tutorial/how-make-rubber-glove-or-sock-mold>{: rel="noreferrer"}

This will take more time and effort than a single-piece block mold, since I'll need to build up 
several layers of silicone for the glove mold, and then make the support shell separately, but has a couple
of advantages.

First, it can be turned inside out to release the final casting which should help release the knot
in the middle. With a block mold, I think I'd need to cut a split in the side, and then worry about flashing that would
need to be removed after casting. Since both the mold and cast are flexible, though, that might not be necessary.

Second, the foam is much cheaper by volume than silicone. The same 75 fluid ounces of 3 lb foam, cast at 5 lbs,
(I'm using FlexFoam-iT III) will cost about $4.50, but would cost about $130 in silicone.

For the first coat, I first made a quick mold for registration keys that will be used to align the silicone mold with the foam shell,
using unbaked Sculpey.

For the first coat, I mixed up 30 grams of Rebound 25, and started by pouring two of the three registration keys, but I felt
like I wouldn't have enough silicone for the first coat, and storted brushing on the first coat instead.

The pigment in part B of the rebound is flourescent, so I found that I could easily thin spots in the first coat using
a UV flashlight, which I'll fill in on the second coat.
