My first attempt at silicone casting: making a large, fantasy/unrealistic dildo.

There's a great deal of quality information available for the modeling/molding/casting process, but rarely in one place,
and mostly not specific to sex toys, which have their own unique challenges.

I haven't done any molding/casting before, so [some mistakes will be made](/toys/mistakes).

**Outline**

## Materials

I'll primarily be using the following materials

* Chavant NSP clay for the positive model
* Smooth-On Rebound 25 brush on silicone for the mold
* ~~Smooth-On FlexFoam-iT III for the mold shell~~
* Extra fast plaster bandages for the mold shell.
* Smooth-On Ecoflex 00-50 silicone for the cast
* Cosmetic mica for color

Detailed materials and parts list (with cost) here: [Material costs](/toys/costs)

## Sculpting

For clay, I'm using Chavant NSP, in hard. NSP is a oil, wax, and mineral clay
that does not dry out or harden. At room temperature, it's pretty firm, and can be carved and accepts
sharp detail. It's non-sulphur, and won't prevent platinum silicone from curing.

While I like that the clay can be reused, and that it's firm enough not to show fingerprints every time I touch it,
I would probably prefer to use a polymer clay (like Super Sculpey) for a smaller toy.
After baking, it can be sanded and filled to get a a very smooth finish, with much less effort.

I started with 2 lbs of clay, softened in the microwave. I used 1/4&quot; armature wire,
and wrapped crumpled aluminum foil around that to bulk out to about 1&quot; in diameter.

I wrapped and mooshed the softened clay around the armature and foil, and made rough base, and bulked it out further
with coils of clay.

If I did this again, I'd better plan out what I was working on (with a drawing), and the dimensions
I wanted to target. I could have been using more foil and less clay (this used about 1.5lbs, but
 could have used less than half of that with better planning). Instead, I just kind of built
it up organically until I liked it, and then added a big knot in the middle for no real reason.

### Tools

I made a couple of different types rake tools to help level and smooth surfaces. For coarse tools,
I cut teeth into ribbon/loop tools with a dremel and a cutting wheel.

For finer rakes, I used 3 different gauges of steel instrument strings (bass and guitar).

For the guitar ones, I cut two short lengths of wire and wedged the ends into
1/4&quot; brass tubing, and crimped the ends together. Then, I added Fixit Sculpt for support, and to keep
the loops from flexing as much.

See: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m55SDY4x098>{: rel="noreferrer} on making rake tools like these.

For the bass strings, I whipped the ends with finer gauge wire so that they'd keep their shape, and
embedded them in Fixit Sculpt, as a handle.

### Smoothing

First, I try to get the shape close without worrying about the surface, and erring on the side of too
much clay, rather than too little.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/small_raking.jpg" description="Testing tools on scrap clay" %}

After letting the warm clay cool, or chilling it in the refrigerator, I used the toothed loop tools above
to knock down high spots, and rough in the shape.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/raking.jpg" description="Raking with finer tools before smoothing" %}

I tried a few things to get a smooth surface after using a fine rake.

I tried heat, using both butane torch, and a small heat gun, but both were difficult to control, either
causing the surface to bubble, or not heat quickly enough causing deformation.

For solvents, I tried both rubbing alcohol and mineral oil. Both worked, but the alcohol was
unpredictable and I was worried about ruining the clay. Mineral oil made smoothing easy,
but left the surface tacky. It still seems useful, but I'm not sure how to fix the stickiness.

In the end, I just used dish soap to prevent the clay from smearing and tearing and tried to press it smooth
by hand as best I could.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/wip_front.jpg" description="Front of model after smoothing" %}

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/wip_back.jpg" description="Back of model after smoothing" %}

This model is about 9.5&quot; long total, and 2.75&quot; in diameter at the widest point, 2.25&quot; at the head.

### Details

After basic smoothing, I went back in and added some additional detail around the head, and rolled out clay snakes to make
veins around the base.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/veins_smooth.jpg" description="After smoothing with dish soap. Ignore fuzz from shirt" %}

I decided to make the toy's base taller, so that running a little short on silicone (or mixing a bit too much) would 
still make for an adequate base. I just smoothed down a pancake of clay and stuck it on the bottom.

I could have gotten a more professional result here by making sure the base was both level and circular. It could have been
cut out of wood, or just built on top of some round platform instead.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/bigger_base.jpg" description="Adding some height to the base" %}

I did one more pass at smoothing rough spots, filling in pits, and removing little lint balls of clay that accumulated.

## Molding

For the mold, I'm using Smooth-On's Rebound 25 to make a one-piece, flexible, glove mold, 
and then plan to support it with expanding foam. See:
<https://www.polytek.com/tutorial/how-make-rubber-glove-or-sock-mold>{: rel="noreferrer"}

This will take more time and effort than a single-piece block mold, since I'll need to build up 
several layers of silicone for the glove mold, and then make the support shell separately, but has a couple
of advantages.

First, it can be turned inside out to release the final casting which should help release the knot
in the middle. With a block mold, I think I'd need to cut a split in the side, and then worry about flashing that would
need to be removed after casting. Since both the mold and cast are flexible, though, that might not be necessary.

Second, the foam is much cheaper by volume than silicone. The same 75 fluid ounces of 3 lb foam, cast at 5 lbs,
(I'm using FlexFoam-iT III) will cost about $4.50, but would cost about $130 in silicone.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/brush_on_test.jpg" description="Clay with a single, thin layer of Rebound 25. I'm testing for cure inhibition" %}

For the first coat, I first made a quick mold for registration keys that will be used to align the silicone mold with the foam shell,
using unbaked Sculpey.

I mixed up 30 grams of Rebound 25, and started by pouring two of the three registration keys, but I felt
like I wouldn't have enough silicone for the first coat, and storted brushing on the first coat instead.

I recommend adding a pigment to the first coat, if using over a brown clay like this one.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/first_coat.jpg" description="Clay with first coat of Rebound 25" %}

The pigment in part B of the rebound is fluorescent, so I found that I could easily thin spots in the first coat using
a UV flashlight, which I'll fill in on the second coat.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/uv.jpg" description="Rebound 25 under UV light" %}

Added one more thin coat, then one coat thickened with thi-vex.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/thickened.jpg" description="2nd coat, followed by thickened Rebound" %}

Added one more thin coat, one thick, and one thin, then trimmed the base.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/trimmed.jpg" description="Inner mold finished" %}

### FlexFoam Shell

I'm testing release agens, temperature and mixing methods without much luck. Foam shrinks away from the mold walls,
or falls, or doesn't rise nearly as much as it ought to.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/foam_tests.jpg" description="FlexFoam-iT III in cups" %}

### Plan B, Plaster shell

I used 3&quot;x9&apos; extra-fast plaster bandages for the outer mold shell. 3&quot; was a bit skinny for this, though, so I'd
probably use 4-6&quot; instead in the future.

I used 4 layers at the edges and the seams, and 3 layers for the rest.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/plaster_half.jpg" description="First half of the plaster bandage mold" %}

After half an hour, I used petroleum jelly along the overlapping part of the seam, and used just over a roll for the second
half.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/plaster_full.jpg" description="Second half of the shell done" %}

Pulled the mold apart an hour later so that it can finish setting with both sides exposed to the air.

### Removing the Mold

I had some trouble removing the clay positive at first without damaging it. I chilled the mold and clay in the fridge
for a couple of hours, sprayed the outside with mold release, and then was able to work the positive out. I think it would
still require some touch up if I wanted to use it again.

I was able to find a couple of bubbles near the base, but I think it will be OK. I considered trying to patch the holes
with more silicone, but I think I'd just make a mess of it.

The silicone ended up thinner toward the top, since I usually started there before the silicone has a chance to firm
up slightly, allowing it to run downhill more than other areas.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/inside_out.jpg" description="Inverted silicone mold" %}

Afterward, I measured the water it took to fill and should have enough silicone even with generous overages.
I'm going to let the mother mold finish setting for a day or two and then finish casting.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/mold_inside.jpg" description="Interior of brush-on glove mold" %}

To hold the mold upright for pouring, I just cut a hole in the top of a cardboard box, and taped the box up a bit for strength.

I don't have mold straps, so I used electrical tape to keep the mold shell closed tightly.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/taped_mold.jpg" description="Plaster mold with electrical tape" %}


## Casting

I turned the mold inside out first and gave it a light spray of Ease Release 200, and brushed it around a bit, then turned the mold
rightside in again, and gave it a 2 medium/heavy coats of release, and let it sit for about 20 minutes.

Since I don't have a degassing chamber (yet), I used [the _bomb's away_](https://youtu.be/WtodXHMDOP8?t=247){: rel="noreferrer"} to hopefully
reduce the number of bubbles in the final cast. I drilled a 1/4&quot; hole at the bottom of the side of a quart mixing container,
and put a strip of masking tape over it.

Earlier, I measured the mold at about 20.5 fluid ounces, and mixed up about 26 fluid ounces of silicone (822 grams), 
which was way too much, even after deciding against making the bottom a suction cup, and losses when transferring silicone.

I probably could have gotten away with ~23.5 fluid ounces and not run low, or even 21­22 with a suction cup.

I added about 2.5 grams of purple cosmetic mica, and 4.11 grams of Slo-Jo to part B and mixed thoroughly.
The Slo-Jo should bring the the pot life of the mixed silicone from 18 minutes up to an hour, and the demold time from 2 hours
up to 4, though I'll be leaving it a bit longer, since I'm casting below 73°F. I wasn't sure how long
it would take to finish mixing the silicone and pouring. I think I could have gotten by without the Slo-Jo, but it may
also help the the silicone degas further before curing.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/partb.jpg" description="Ecoflex Part B with mica" %}

After mixing with part A, the silicone still seems plenty purple (though maybe mare glittery and pearlescent, so I didn't
bother adding more mica. I thought that I might need as much as 14 grams for this volume, based on what I've read from
resin and soap casters. Not sure what it'll look like after demolding.

I then transferred it to pre-drilled container and mixed for a couple more minutes.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/mixed.jpg" description="Ecoflex all mixed up. So pretty" %}

I poured from a 4 foot step ladder down into the mold, trying to keep the mold angled at first so that the silicone poured into
the very bottom, instead of rolling down the side. Mostly successful. Before pouring, I disabled the house hvac, and even so
even the slightest air current blew the tiny stream of silicone off course.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/pour.jpg" description="Pouring silicone into the mold" %}

After pouring, I set it aside to cure overnight.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/poured.jpg" description="Silicone pour complete" %}


### Demolding the Toy

The toy was ready to demold in about 6 hours, and was much easier to remove than the clay positive had been,
since both the mold and toy are strong and stretchy.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/done.jpg" description="Finished toy, with ruler for scale (out of bananas)" %}

Looks good overall! There are some issues, though.
 
First, the color didn't come out as I hoped. It's very purple, but I was hoping for a wavier mica look, 
like this commercial toy:

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/mica.jpg" description="Commercial silicone toy mica" %}

It could be that I didn't use enough mica for that effect, or that a faster cure time might have retained some of the
effect, I'm not sure. I have a little bit of silicone left that I'm going to use for testing with different ratios.

Secondly, it's very floppy and doesn't stand up on it's own because of it. I'd like to find another silicone between the firmness
of Ecoflex 00-50 and Dragonskin, but have only found one supplier so far with that firmness (Magickmold P-508 from Raw Material Suppliers).

Lastly, and most importantly, the thing is full of bubbles, though they're difficult to see in these photos.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/toys/bubbles.jpg" description="Surface bubbles in silicone" %}

Obviously degassing is an option, but I'm going to try to recast with a lower viscosity silicone that _shouldn't_
require vacuum degassing, like Dragonskin NV (shore 10A, probably too firm) or Magikmold P-508 (shore 8A).
