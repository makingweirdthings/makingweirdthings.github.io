## DIY Tools

I wanted a set of rake tools. I had guitar strings, but no small diameter
brass or aluminum tubing.

I used electrical tape to hold short lengths of the strings to wooden dowels.

This worked fine, except that it eventually left black residue from the electrical tape onto
the outside of the clay I was working with. Since electrical tape is vinyl, and can prevent
platinum silicone from curing.

I removed some of the worst affected areas, and tried a few test patches with the brush-on
silicone to make sure it would still cure, but I was worried that I'd ruined both the sculpt and
the clay used.

I remade these tools using crimped brass tubing and Fixit Sculpt instead.

I'm not sure how this happened, and plead exhaustion.
 
The first time I mixed up the brush-on silicone, I carefully measured out 10 grams of part A, 
closed the container, set it aside, and then (apparently) carefully grabbed the same container 
again, measured out a second helping of part A, mixed the two, and applied it to the clay I 
was working with, expecting it to cure.

It was cold in my workspace (below the recommended minimum of 65Â°F), but when it still hadn't
become tacky after 2 hours, I opened part B to check the material color, only to find the 
container was still sealed.

I cleaned the (unmixed) silicone off with water and paper towels. Unsurprisingly, mixed silicone
set up much better.
