## DIY Tools

I wanted a set of rake tools. I had guitar strings, but no small diameter
brass or aluminum tubing.

I used electrical tape to hold short lengths of the strings to wooden dowels.

This worked fine, except that it eventually left black residue from the electrical tape onto
the outside of the clay I was working with. Since electrical tape is vinyl, and can prevent
platinum silicone from curing.

I removed some of the worst affected areas, and tried a few test patches with the brush-on
silicone to make sure it would still cure, but I was worried that I'd ruined both the sculpt and
the clay used.

I remade these tools using crimped brass tubing and Fixit Sculpt instead.

## 2A:0B

I'm not sure how this happened, and plead exhaustion.
 
The first time I mixed up the brush-on silicone, I carefully measured out 10 grams of part A, 
closed the container, set it aside, and then (apparently) carefully grabbed the same container 
again, measured out a second helping of part A, mixed the two, and applied it to the clay I 
was working with, expecting it to cure.

It was cold in my workspace (below the recommended minimum of 65Â°F), but when it still hadn't
become tacky after 2 hours, I opened part B to check the material color, only to find the 
container was still sealed.

I cleaned the (unmixed) silicone off with water and paper towels. Unsurprisingly, mixed silicone
set up much better.

## Brush-on Molds

It was really easy to underestimate the amount of Rebound 25 to mix up for the second coat.
The first coat tends to 'grab' the second one, and it's more difficult to brush on as thinly as the first.
 
 Also, I was afraid of disturbing the first layer, and I'm sure I did somewhat. I'm hoping this doesn't 
 affect the final outcome too terribly.
 
 I used 30 grams of rebound for the first and second coat, but I probably should have used at least 40 or 50 instead.

I'm more interested in trying make [a matrix mold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1bLTp-K9Rc){: rel="noreferrer"} 
instead next time.

## Registration Keys and Cure Inhibition

Tried to make some registration keys using (uncured) Sculpey while making the brush on mold.

While (I believe) cured Sculpey shouldn't inhibit platinum silicone, the keys were still a sticky mess after a couple of
hours. Probably should have verified first, and just used oil clay instead.

## Foam Mothermold

It's possible that I got a bad batch, or that it was exposed to low temperatures during shipping, but I haven't 
had any luck getting FlexFoam-iT to set up correctly. I made a bunch of small tests molds, and regardless of ambient
temperature, or mixing methods, I cannot get it to set up correctly, or expand to the expected volume.

Even with low expansion, I don't think the foam is dense enough to support the thin silicone shell around
a tall, liquid silicone pour. Going to try switching to a plaster bandage shell instead.
