There were a few issues in the first casting that I'm hoping to fix in this second attempt.

The toy is slightly softer than I wanted at 5a. For comparison, my guess is it lands somewhere between Bad Dragon's
soft and medium.

The mica color is a pretty homogenous purple, and I'd like to have a more interesting/deeper looking swirl look when
it's done. There are a couple of reasons for this, I think.

Because I didn't know how long mixing the silicone, mica, and pouring through a small hole in the mixing container would take,
I used a cure retardant to allow more working time, but also more time for the mica in solution equalize a bit more.

Because I was using a high-viscosity silicone, I tried to reduce surface bubbles using [the bombs away method](https://youtu.be/WtodXHMDOP8?t=247){: rel="noreferrer"},
which slows the pour down a great deal, and (I think) is likely to allow the mica to mix further.

The second and more important issue is that (because I'm not using a vacuum degassing chamber, nor low-viscosity/no-vacuum silicone)
the first try had a lot of surface bubbles around slopes, where bubbles had some resistance to rising. This makes some of the surface
slightly porous and more difficult to clean.

To get around these, I'm using a slightly firmer, and much lower viscosity platinum silicone: Magikmold P-508.
P-508 has a shore hardness of 8A (vs EcoFlex's 00-50, roughly 5A), and a viscosity of just 2,400 cps (vs EcoFlex's 8,000 cps).
For comparison, DragonSkin NV has a viscosity low enough to not require vacuum degassing, at 6,000 cps.

I'm going to work a bit faster, and pour more normally from the mixed container, not using a cure retardant, and mix the
(slightly more) mica into the silicone later in the process, so that it's mixed less thoroughly.

Should this not work out, then I'll consider a vacuum degassing chamber required for toy making.

## Molding

I'm trying to make a small (weak) suction cup this time, by resting the bottom of a stainless steel bowl in the upturned
mold as it cures.

To keep it at the right depth, I taped a piece of cardboard to the bowl so that it can partially rest on the top of the mold.

After pouring, I held a vibrator to the mold for a couple of minutes, then sprayed the top surface with release agent 
to pop the surface bubbles, and then set the steel bowl down into the mix.
